# Standardized Big Data Management

Cassandra RegRep is a registry and repository (RegRep) specialized for the Big Data Information Management based upon 
the OASIS ebXML RegRep standard. It enables seamless secure management of almost any kind of digital content associated 
with a pre-defined and Standard-compliant metadata description.

If the following keywords characterize your requirements or problem domain this Cassandra-based and standard-compliant registry & 
repository is a must have:
* Big Data
* Interoperability
* Metadata Management
* Information Management
* Registry (& Repository)
* Semantic
* Standard-compliant 
* Unified Information Access


## OASIS ebXML RegRep v4.0 for Cassandra

This solution offers an implementation of the building blocks of the OASIS ebXML Standard, 
OASIS ebRS (Services & Protocols) and OASIS ebRIM (Registry Information Model), for an outstanding NoSQL database.

### OASIS ebRS v4.0 for Cassandra
The combination of the latest version of the OASIS ebRS specification with Cassandra provides a mature SOAP-based 
web service being a Standard-compliant access layer for Cassandra.

The OASIS ebRS implementation supports **authentication** based on OASIS SAML v2.0 und **authorization** based on OASIS XACML v2.0.

### OASIS ebRIM v4.0 for Cassandra
The OASIS ebXML Registry Information Model is a feature-rich meta-model that is best suited to support information 
integration and management scenarios, especially in a semantic-driven environment.

The OASIS ebRIM profile is a pure Java layer offering a pre-defined set of Standard-compliant column families derived 
from the newest version of the Registry Information Model. This layer enables Cassandra to become a Standardized platform 
for Big Data Information Management.
